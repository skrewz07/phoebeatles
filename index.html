        <h2>The Album</h2>

        <p>Ever since humankind first asked how the horsey moves, or played air drums with dinosaur bones, masters and musicians have been inextricably intertwined, like strands of nucleotides in deoxyribonucleic acid, or like anacondas in a breeding ball. Indeed, it is no coincidence that one of the OG chess games is the <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1233404" target="_blank">Opera Game</a>, or that musicians prepare or a gig by performing a mic check and not, say, a mic backgammon. From the Giuoco Piano to talk of tempo, chess and music have long gone hand-in-hand, like salt and pepper, or like the French and pain.</p>

        <p>Lately, however, that relationship has been showing signs of decay; what was once Bonnie &amp; Clyde is now more Cain &amp; Abel, what was once Barnes &amp; Barnes is now more Jedward. Despite the admirable efforts of artists such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZA8nwZwEyI" target="_blank">Juga</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QonUTDORoY" target="_blank">juanjo_sound</a>, there is undeniable evidence that chess and music are, like the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, or like Phoebe and her youth, slowly drifting apart. Indeed, lamentably, chessboards are set up incorrectly in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grVicwzhmxc" target="_blank">music videos</a>, and there is no karaoke round in the chess world championship.</p>

        <p>Thus, it was no surprise when the aforementioned Phoebe Witte, <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/profile/1090500" target="_blank">chess player</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/phoebewitte" target="_blank">streamer</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/phoebewitte" target="_blank">influencer</a>, and <a href="https://schaken.nl/verschijningsdatum-schaken-nl-nummer-2-2024" target="_blank">cover girl</a> extraordinaire, commented on the disappointing lack of chess parodies in pop music. This spurred her friends and fans into action, and to properly mark the joyous occasion of her 26th birthday, we decided to right this wrong, imagining how some of the greatest songs of recent times could, and dare we say should, have sounded had their singers been more chessically inclined. Tracing back to when pen was first put to paper (or, more accurately, stylus first put to <a href="https://remarkable.com" target="_blank">tablet</a>), this project has been six months in the making, and so Phoebe, we sincerely hope that you will enjoy the end product, have the happiest of birthdays, and feel inspired to do your part to reunite chess and music by returning song requests to their rightful price (2500 feebies <img src="assets/icons/peeporiot.gif" alt="peepoRiot">).</p>

          <p>When people walk past Anna-Maja in public, it's not a question of whether or not they recognise her, but rather what they recognise her from, because this Renaissance woman has done everything. She's one of the Netherlands' top women players (if you can name a tournament, Anna-Maja's probably won it), she starred on The Genius (a Dutch reality TV show), and she hosts one of the most educational chess channels on Twitch. A little less well known is the fact that Anna-Maja used to perform as a singer when she was younger, and has coupled her singing and chess talents before - just as Hasselhoff brought down the Berlin Wall, Anna-Maja's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wtjgc5rzU" target="_blank">previous parody</a> fixed chess.com's server issues.
