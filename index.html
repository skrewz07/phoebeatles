        <h2>The Album</h2>

        <p>Ever since humankind first asked how the horsey moves, or played air drums with dinosaur bones, masters and musicians have been inextricably intertwined, like strands of nucleotides in deoxyribonucleic acid, or like anacondas in a breeding ball. Indeed, it is no coincidence that one of the OG chess games is the <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1233404" target="_blank">Opera Game</a>, or that musicians prepare or a gig by performing a mic check and not, say, a mic backgammon. From the Giuoco Piano to talk of tempo, chess and music have long gone hand-in-hand, like salt and pepper, or like the French and pain.</p>

        <p>Lately, however, that relationship has been showing signs of decay; what was once Bonnie &amp; Clyde is now more Cain &amp; Abel, what was once Barnes &amp; Barnes is now more Jedward. Despite the admirable efforts of artists such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZA8nwZwEyI" target="_blank">Juga</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QonUTDORoY" target="_blank">juanjo_sound</a>, there is undeniable evidence that chess and music are, like the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, or like Phoebe and her youth, slowly drifting apart. Indeed, lamentably, chessboards are set up incorrectly in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grVicwzhmxc" target="_blank">music videos</a>, and there is no karaoke round in the chess world championship.</p>

        <p>Thus, it was no surprise when the aforementioned Phoebe Witte, <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/profile/1090500" target="_blank">chess player</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/phoebewitte" target="_blank">streamer</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/phoebewittechess" target="_blank">influencer</a>, and <a href="https://schaken.nl/verschijningsdatum-schaken-nl-nummer-2-2024" target="_blank">cover girl</a> extraordinaire, commented on the disappointing lack of chess parodies in pop music. This spurred her friends and fans into action, and to properly mark the joyous occasion of her 26th birthday, we decided to right this wrong, imagining how some of the greatest songs of recent times could, and dare we say should, have sounded had their singers been more chessically inclined. Tracing back to when pen was first put to paper (or, more accurately, stylus first put to <a href="https://remarkable.com" target="_blank">tablet</a>), this project has been six months in the making, and so Phoebe, we sincerely hope that you will enjoy the end product, have the happiest of birthdays, and feel inspired to do your part to reunite chess and music by returning song requests to their rightful price (2500 feebies <img src="assets/icons/peeporiot.gif" alt="peepoRiot">).</p>

        <h2>The Artists</h2>

        <p>As excited as I was for this album, there was one obvious problem - it would be cruel to subject people to my singing, but how could I possibly rope others into this insanity? Much to my surprise - and I do not yet know if this is evidence of humanity's inherent kindness or Phoebe's persuasive pull - these incredible individuals needed no convincing to join the project, lending their spectacular talents to bring the songs to life. While these Twitch celebrities need no introduction, I (as you might have gathered by now) like writing, so I shall introduce them anyways. In case you have been living under a rock (by which I mean a large stone, and not the musical genre), you will also find links where you can follow them and consume their wonderful content.</p>

          <p>When people walk past Anna-Maja in public, it's not a question of whether or not they recognise her, but rather what they recognise her from, because this Renaissance woman has done everything. She's one of the Netherlands' top women players (if you can name a tournament, Anna-Maja's probably won it), she starred on The Genius (a Dutch reality TV show), and she hosts one of the most educational chess channels on Twitch. A little less well-known is the fact that Anna-Maja used to perform as a singer when she was younger, and has coupled her singing and chess talents before - just as Hasselhoff brought down the Berlin Wall, Anna-Maja's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wtjgc5rzU" target="_blank">previous parody</a> fixed chess.com's server issues.</p>

          <p>This talented Tasmanian plays the piano, guitar, bass (presumably not the fish, but I wouldn't put it past him), and more, and his cover of "Ordinary People" will live long in the memory. But it was during the heydays of chess on Twitch that he started streaming, and chess was his main category - although he was relatively new to the game, he quickly made quite the impression on the scene, as he was raided by none other than GM Hikaru, while he and his many fans also took over Anna Cramling's chat with his 'No d4' emote. Although his streaming days appear to be behind him, Twitch's loss is the world's gain, as he has now added being an arbiter to his many accomplishments.</p>

          <p>Gauri puts the 'Win' in 'Windy City' - this Chicago-based streamer has treated his audience to some extraordinary chess. With his trademark offerings of either Slow and Instructive or Fast and Furious chess, there's something for everyone. But I would be remiss not to mention Gauri's over-the-board exploits: a few days ago, having amassed the world's largest IM norm collection, Gauri beat a GM to achieve the rating required to become an International Master! The fact that he took time out from preparing for this crucial tournament to record this song bears witness to his wonderful character. And speaking of wonderful - the keyboard in his stream room isn't just decorative. If you're lucky, you'll catch a rendition of "Closing Time" at the end of a stream.</p>

          <p>Stereotypes suggest chess masters are serious and bookish folks, but two-time African Chess Champion Jesse February shows that is not always the case. While the South African is devoted to chess - she is on the road to the WGM title, and is currently setting up a chess club in Saudi Arabia - she also has a flair for <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/k6vFO4nbsaE" target="_blank">hilarious content creation</a>, as one would expect from the self-declared Queen of the Memes. Finally, Jesse's incredible vocal talent - both for singing and for accents - make her the perfect fit for this project, so we're so glad she said yes!</p>

          <p>Many streamers talk the talk about "growing the game," but few walk the walk as wholeheartedly as Joe does. In one of those cosmic coincidences that makes you believe in a higher power, Joe <i>Bruin</i> went to UCLA (the Bruins), where he was president of the chess club and founded the widely popular collegiate chess league. He is continuing his professional devotion to chess by working for chess.com, but on his own time, he is proving to be one of the threads that holds the fabric of Twitch chess together, as he spends his free time coaching, commentating for, and collaborating with a number of newer streamers - no doubt you'll have seen his friendly face on your favourite streamers' channels.</p>

          <p>Asking Liv Harris to be on your parody album is a bit like asking Magnus Carlsen to play for your local chess club, but by some miracle, she agreed! If there's only one music streamer you follow, make sure it's this singer-songwriter from London, who has been entertaining her Twitch audience for over seven years. Liv's streams are filled with awesome originals and chilling covers, with the smoothest of segues to tie them all together, but what really sets her apart is the infectious enthusiasm and joy she brings - I guarantee that tuning into her channel will leave you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH3V69lPeWY" target="_blank">feeling good</a>.</p>

          <p>Perhaps one of Twitch's best-kept secrets, panipaji came back to regular streaming at the start of this year, and has taken to the platform like a Choe Hyon-class destroyer to water. As you might expect from an Elon Musk employee in an on-again off-again relationship with Kim Jong Un, Pani's streams encapsulate the full spectrum of human existence, with content ranging from chess (where she has shown a nine-fold increase in her Elo since January) to music to dance to community games to Minecraft to attack helicopter dating sims. Wait until she is live to be properly rewarded for your follow, but be warned - you'll end up wanting her so bad.</p>
